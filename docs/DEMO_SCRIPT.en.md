# FoMON3D Two-Minute Demo Script (English)

Recommended duration: around 2 minutes  
Suggested visuals: `flowchart.png` + live frontend demo

## 0:00 - 0:12 Team intro

Voice-over:
"Hi everyone, we are the FoMON3D team. Our members are `0x_JBCat` and `0xTaki.eth`."

## 0:12 - 0:25 Project intro

Voice-over:
"FoMON3D is built to finance an `Agent Vault`. We use a game mechanism to aggregate user capital, so the Agent treasury has real working capital to run strategies."

## 0:25 - 1:20 FoMON3D gameplay demo

Voice-over:
"Step one: a user deposits `MON`, starts a FoMON3D round, and receives `FoMON LST token`.  
Step two: if another user deposits within the time limit, the countdown refreshes.  
Step three: the current demo uses a `30s` timer only for presentation. On Monad mainnet, this can be reduced to `1s` to make the game extremely intense.  
This can also act as a Monad performance stress test: if you can break Monad mainnet for one second, you can take the prize.  
Step four: if nobody deposits again, the round ends, and the last depositor wins.  
Step five: rewards are settled in `FoMON LST token`, and users click `redeem` to convert back to `MON`."

## 1:20 - 1:40 Treasury lock and strategy

Voice-over:
"By controlling the `redeem` window, we keep user capital in the Treasury for a period of time.  
During this lock period, the Agent uses the capital on `Nad.fun` to launch interesting MEME tokens, then exits through `initial buy + TWAP sell` to generate treasury yield. In strategy terms, this is designed to be close to a low-risk yield process."

## 1:40 - 1:52 Current status

Voice-over:
"The Agent-driven MEME launch automation is not fully complete yet. We are continuing to finish and ship this module."

## 1:52 - 2:00 Closing

Voice-over:
"That is FoMON3D. Thank you for listening."
